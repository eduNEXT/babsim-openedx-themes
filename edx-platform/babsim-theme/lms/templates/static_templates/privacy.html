    	<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    	<h4>Last Updated: 9/24/2018</h4>
    	<p>This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to your access and use of the academy.babsim.com website (the “Site”) owned and operated by Babbage Simmel (referred to as “Babbage Simmel,” or “we,” or “us”).</p></br>

    	<p>BY ACCESSING AND USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY IT.
		We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. Any modifications will be effective immediately upon such posting. YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SITE AFTER SUCH MODIFICATIONS ARE POSTED WILL SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE MODIFICATIONS AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THEM. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any modifications to this Privacy Policy shall not apply to any dispute between us arising prior to the date on which we post the revised Privacy Policy that contain such modifications.</p></br>

		<h4>YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
		<p>Personal Information You Give Us</p>
		<p>We collect and may transmit personally identifiable information that you provide to us through the Site (“Your Information”). Personally identifiable information that we collect and transmit may include, but will not be limited to: your first and last name, physical address, e-mail address, telephone number, and any other identifier that permits us to contact you.</p>
		<p>Information We Collect Though the Site</p>
		<p>Whenever you interact with the Site, we automatically receive and record information from your browser. Other information collected automatically may include your IP address, the type of browser or application you are using to access the Site, and the identity of the Site page or feature you are requesting. We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, and gather broad demographic data for aggregate use. We may also collect information regarding the device(s) you use to access or use the Site.</p></br>
		<p>To collect this information, we may use “cookies” or other tracking technologies to track how you use the Site. We also may send instructions to your computer or device using JavaScript or other computer languages to gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with the Site. A cookie is a file stored on your computer or device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your computer or device. If applicable, our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser, application, or mobile device when you click on ads that appear on the Site. Clicking on a link to a third party website from our Site may also allow that third party website to also transmit cookies to you.</p>
		<p>We may also use “web beacons”, i.e. “web bugs” or “single–pixel” or “clear” GIFs, on the Site. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their website.</p>
		<p>You may adjust your web browser software if you do not wish to receive cookies or web beacons, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of the Site’s features. Please refer to your browser or e-mail software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Babbage Simmel does not recognize “do not track” signals from your web browser. Be sure to review the privacy policy of any third party website you visit because this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies or web beacons by any third parties. You may also request to opt-out of an advertiser’s use of cookies by visiting the National Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance. You may request to opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting www.google.com/ads/preferences. All applicable terms on these websites will apply to your request to opt-out in addition to this Privacy Policy.</p>
