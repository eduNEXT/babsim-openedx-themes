		<h4>CERTIFICATES AND OTHER PRODUCTS & SERVICES</h4>

		<p><strong>Generally.</strong> From time to time, Babbage Simmel & Associates, Inc. and the colleges, universities, and other institutions providing courses and programs on the Babbage Simmel Academy Site (collectively, the "Members") may offer services and products for a fee (for example, course and program certificates). For anything that you choose to purchase on the Babbage Simmel Academy Site, you agree to pay all applicable fees when due. As described in the Privacy Policy, the processing of your payment information is done by a third-party payment vendor, and you will be routed to a secure payment flow controlled by that vendor to complete the payment transaction. Once your payment transaction is completed, an Babbage Simmel Academy confirmation page will be displayed, and you will receive a confirmation email with your name, order number, and the payment amount. Please retain this email for your records as this information will be required if you seek a refund from Babbage Simmel Academy, as described below.</p></br>

		<p><strong>Certificates.</strong> Babbage Simmel & Associates, Inc. and the Members may offer ID Verified Certificates of Achievement for courses (a "Verified Certificate") or certificates for programs (for example, a MicroMasters program certificate) for learners who, in the Members’ judgment, have satisfactorily demonstrated mastery of the course or program material. Certificates will be issued by Babbage Simmel Academy under the name of the underlying Member(s) from where the course or program originated, i.e. HarvardX, MITx, etc. The decision whether a certificate will be awarded to a given learner will be solely within the discretion of the awarding Member.</p></br>

		<p>Subject to the foregoing, you will be required to pay a fee and complete the ID verification process for Verified Certificates. In order to authenticate your identity for a Verified Certificate, you will be prompted to take a webcam photo of yourself, as well as a photo of an acceptable form of photo ID (described below). Although these items are collected by Babbage Simmel Academy in accordance with these TOS and the Privacy Policy, you should be aware that the actual authentication of your identity is performed by an Babbage Simmel Academy third-party service provider and this information will be used only for the purpose of verifying your identity. Acceptable forms of photo ID’s are:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Government or State-issued driver's license</li>
			<li>Passport</li>
			<li>National ID card</li>
			<li>State or Province ID card (including cards issued by motor vehicle agencies)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In order to be accepted by Babbage Simmel Academy, your photo ID must:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Contain your full name exactly (excluding hyphens, accents, and spaces);</li>
			<li>Contain a relatively current photograph of yourself;</li>
			<li>Be an original document; photocopied documents cannot be accepted; and</li>
			<li>Be current and valid; expired documents cannot be accepted.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Unfortunately, if you do not possess a photo ID meeting the criteria described above, Babbage Simmel Academy is unable to provide you with a Verified Certificate at this time.</p></br>

		<p><strong>Refunds.</strong>Certificates and other purchases on the Babbage Simmel Academy Site may be eligible for a refund for a period of time (in each case, the “Refund Period”). The applicable Refund Period for some products and services are described below. To request a refund for a purchase that you made, please email us at academy@babsim.com and include your full name and order number in your email request. Refunds will be credited to the credit card used for the purchase and may take up to two billing cycles to process. If the applicable Refund Period for a purchase has passed, but you believe a refund is warranted, please email us at academy@babsim.com.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Verified Certificate Track:</strong> For enrollment in the verified certificate track of a course, you have a period of 14 days after your payment or 14 days after your course starts (up to 60 days after your payment) whichever occurs later, during which you may withdraw or unenroll from the course by clicking on the unenroll link on the learner dashboard and request a refund by emailing academy@babsim.com.</li>
